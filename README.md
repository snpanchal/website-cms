# widget-corp-cms

This is a content management system for a fictional company named Widget Corp that I created while learning server-side scripting using PHP and MySQL. All data for the site is saved in MySQL tables, which is injected into the requested PHP page when receiving a GET request. Furthermore, there are functions to add new pages, change the navigation hierarchy, and edit or delete existing pages. As well, like any CMS should have, there is a login system so only authorized users can edit the site's content. For this login feature, I used one-way MD5 hashing, base-64 encoding, and salting techniques.
